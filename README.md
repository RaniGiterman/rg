After installing, create a `.env` file, and specify the path to your .rg file.
Your `.env` file should have something similiar to:
`FILE=./main.rg`
<br>

Now let's code some RG!
Here's an implementation of the classic fizzbuzz coding problem in rg:

```js
i = 1

@for $i <= 100; i = $i + 1
   state = ""

   @if $i % 3 == 0 && $i % 5 == 0
       print("FizzBuzz")
       state = "yes"
   @fi

   @if $i % 3 == 0 && !$state
       print("Fizz")
       state = "yes"
   @fi

   @if $i % 5 == 0 && !$state
       print("Buzz")
       state = "yes"
   @fi

   @if !$state
       print($i)
   @fi
@rof
```

To get the value of a variable, write a dollar sign ($), then the name of the variable.

To run the file, run the following from the root of your project: `node node_modules/argee/interpreter.js`

- nested for loops and nested ifs are not supported.
  <br>
- If you do write them, you will most likely receive an unexpected result, if not a compile error.
  <br>
- There is no such thing as else or else-ifs, as rg encourages you to confidently state all possible conditions.

<br>
rg inspires to be yet another language you can add to your arsenal of skills and programming languages, then forget about it and move on in life.
<br>
rg's interpreter is written in Javascript, making it one of the slowest languages on earth.
